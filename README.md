# Fine-Tune-Large-Language-Model-for-Behavioral-Activation-Chatbot

The development of a BA Chatbot utilizing a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model combined with the RAG framework represents a significant advancement in digital mental health solutions, specifically tailored to Behavioral Activation (BA). The BA Chatbot not only introduces users to BA principles but also offers personalized activity recommendations, incorporates four strategic incentive mechanisms, and provides comprehensive schedule management and mood tracking functionalities. By catering to the unique needs of BA, this chatbot stands as a testament to the potential of leveraging advanced AI technologies to enhance the effectiveness of BA interventions, offering a promising tool for individuals seeking support in managing their mental well-being.

The BA Chatbot's architecture is built on the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, encompassing retrieval, integration, and generation stages. It begins by using cosine similarity to retrieve relevant information from two external sources, which is then combined with user input to construct prompts. These prompts are structured to guide the model's responses, incorporating Instructions that set the task, User Input that adds specificity, and the anticipated Response that showcases the model's output diversity and relevance. This composite data is processed by GPT-3.5-turbo, enhancing the chatbot's functionality by leveraging varied external sources to enrich its knowledge base, thus improving the accuracy and relevance of its responses.
The BA Chatbot integrates two main feature sets: 
  	LLM-based features: BA introductions，activity recommendation， four incentive mechanisms ，mood intervention，mood tracking 
  	Google Calendar API based feature：schedule management.
